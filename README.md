What is GodsEye:
GodsEye is an Advanced Modern Cheat Detection System.
GodsEye's main goal is to detect cheaters without taking too much of your server resources while not interrupting your player's experience on the server

What can GodsEye do?

GodsEye's Hack Detection:
With GodsEye we make sure to keep its checks/detection systems up to date and working against the most modern advanced hack clients but also keep the server's performance in a good state while also making sure to not false ban laggy players meaning GodsEye's checks account to connection and server sided lag in its calculations, GodsEye takes your legit players experience to the first priority, also since GodsEye was developed not only around the spigot community GodsEye takes the level of the AntiCheats on spigot to a whole new standard and introduces technologies that weren't seen around here before.

  # Features
  - Main Features
  
    - [x] Smart Notification System - The verbose system allows you to see information about every violation given in real-time, but if you prefer to still get information but without getting spammed in the chat, you can use GodsEye's second alerts system which sends reports every time a player reaches a configurable amount of violations.
