What is GodsEye:
GodsEye is an Advanced Modern Cheat Detection System.
GodsEye's main goal is to detect cheaters without taking too much of your server resources while not interrupting your player's experience on the server

What can GodsEye do?

GodsEye's Hack Detection:
With GodsEye we make sure to keep its checks/detection systems up to date and working against the most modern advanced hack clients but also keep the server's performance in a good state while also making sure to not false ban laggy players meaning GodsEye's checks account to connection and server sided lag in its calculations, GodsEye takes your legit players experience to the first priority, also since GodsEye was developed not only around the spigot community GodsEye takes the level of the AntiCheats on spigot to a whole new standard and introduces technologies that weren't seen around here before.

  <b>Features</b><br>
- [x] Smart Notification System - The verbose system allows you to see information about every violation given in real-time, but if you prefer to still get information but without getting spammed in the chat, you can use GodsEye's second alerts system which sends reports every time a player reaches a configurable amount of violations.
- [x] LightWeight - Coded to be optimized and makes sure to obfuscate with minimal performance impact as possible while still protecting the code from hack client developers, so if you are not running your server on a potato setup you should be fine.
Fully Automated - GodsEye is completely automated and can detect and punish hackers by itself, just make sure to configure it correctly to work good in your server and you're ready to go!
- [x] Inventory GUI's - GodsEye handles all the data for you in GUI's to make your life easier, all of the features are in a GUI, such as the hackerfinder, checks controls, ac settings, banwave list, punishment logs and more...
Punishment System - GodsEye lets you run every command you want when the player should be kicked/banned which means GodsEye works with every third-party punishment system but it's not dependent on them
- [x] Highly Configurable - All the features can be found on the config file and can be changed/turned ON and OFF includes all the checks, messages timers and more
- [x] Ban Waves - punish a large number of players at the same time, good for big servers and preventing bypasses
Advanced HackerFinder System - GodsEye collects information for you about players who are highly suspected for hacking and show's it in a GUI, so if you weren't there when the player hacked you can still know about every suspected action he did, godseye shows this data in a profile GUI for every player which can be entered by the hackerfinder GUI or with a command
- [x] BanLogs System - GodsEye creates a banlog for every player it bans so you know about GodsEye's actions in all times and sees some information about the banning such as the ping of the player before getting banned how high the TPS on the server was and more, and its all showed in a nice GUI (can be found on the player's profile GUI)
Stable checks - GodsEye makes sure to keep the checks stable and not make an over-aggressive check that will do more damage than benefits that prevent things like lagback/tp back from happening, but if a check is found to be useful but pretty aggressive you will always have the option to make it less aggressive or disable it on the config file
 - [ ] Ban effects - GodsEye has three cool ban effects that you can enable or disable, But Use Them! they are awesome,:cool: but remember that you can always make your own ban effects with the developer API, more information about the developer API can be found below.
 - [ ] Unique detections - Although GodsEye uses detection methods that are known to be successful, GodsEye tires to come up with unique detection techniques and ideas that way once we come up with a new detection it won't be bypassed easily with hack modules like Fly - (Hypixel mode)
 - [ ] Developer API - Our developer API lets users who are developers to inject to godseye systems and lets them have godseye as their advanced detection library for their servers, the API is full of useful features which give tons of flexibility and potential
 - [ ] HealthSpoofer - The health spoofer lets you prevent any clients that have damage indicators with a full unbypassable system, it will present a random amount of health to full the hacker while the true health of the player will not be changed
Auto config updater - the auto-config updater will automatically update your configuration files to the version you have installed without overriding the changes you already made to the files to result in a minimal amount of config resets which means less work for you when installing a new update
